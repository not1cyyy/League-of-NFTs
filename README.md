[League of NFTs](https://github.com/not1cyyy/league-of-nfts) is a fun **P2E Game** based on [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/). It is built on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain. League of NFTs is developed to be fun, user-profitable, and most importantly **Open-Source**, while delivering **intuitive and easy to understand GUI** to ensure quality time for all users.

The game was built on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Blockchain based on the [ERC721 Standard](https://erc721.org/) and tested using the [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) Blockchain and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). All of the smart contracts were written in the [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) programming language using the [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) framework while the client side was written in [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Web3.js](https://web3js.org/).
